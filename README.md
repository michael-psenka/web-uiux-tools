## UI/UX Tools for michaelpsenka.io
This repository contains a collection of UI/UX tools that I've developed for my personal website, michaelpsenka.io. These tools are designed to enhance the user experience and make the website more visually appealing.

## Tools
### Background info text reveal
If your job description (like mine) is way too complicated, it can be nicer to gradually introduce what you do. This was the motivation for this tool: to slowly hone in on what it is exactly that *you* do.

### Metallic elements
Noting too special, just wanted a nicer looking block element for my publications. Was originally going for a glassmorphism effect, but when trying to optimize performance and ease in dark mode I ended up with something more metallic.

## Usage
I've included a demo website here, which includes everything needed to use the tools. While it's written in old-fashioned HTML/CSS/JS, the code is simple enough to be adapted into any modern website development framework.
